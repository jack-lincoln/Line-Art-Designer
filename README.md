# Line-Art-Designer
Line Art Designer is an interactive art design program. It allows for the user to view and modify various elements of a moving, linear art design in a GUI window that is launched when the program is run.

The controls are simple and easy to navigate. The design may be moved forwards or backwards. Let either one run too long, and the design will escape beyond the window! Fortunately, there is a "Reset" button that allows for all settings to be returned to their default state, restoring the design to its starting position. 

Controls include:

Buttons:
* **Design Color**: Moves image forward.<br />
* **Background Color**: Moves image backward.<br />
* **Save**: Saves current image as a PNG file.<br />
* **Reset**: Resets to default settings. This includes the starting point of the image, as well as all combo box and slider settings.<br />

Combo Boxes:
* **Design Color**: Changes the design color set. There are five color schemes.<br />
* **Background Color**: Changes the background color set. There are five color schemes.<br />
* **Background Stripe Count**: Adjusts the number of stripes in the background.<br />
* **Line Type**: Changes the lines used in the design from solid to broken. There are four options.<br />

Sliders:
* **Speed**: Adjusts the speed of the design.<br />
* **Color Count**: Adjusts the number of hues (thus the number of lines) used in the design color scheme.<br />
* **Color Distance**: Adjusts the distance between lines of different hues in the design.<br />
* **Line Distance**: Adjusts how closely knit lines of the same hue are.<br />
* **Line Thickness**: Adjusts the thickness of each line in the design.<br />
* **Dot Distance**: When "Line Type" is not set to "Solid Line", adjusts the distance between each segment of the line.<br />
